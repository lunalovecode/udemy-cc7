		<h1>Quiz Game!</h1>

		<script>
			/*
			Instructions:
			1. Build a function constructor called Question to describe a question. A question should include:
				a.) question itself
				b.) the answer from which the player can choose the correct one (choose an adequate data structure here, array, object, etc.)
				c.) correct answer (number is recommended)
			
			2. Create a couple of questions using the constructor

			3. Store them all using an array

			4. Select one random question and log it to the console, together with the possible answers (each question should have a number) (Hint: write a method for the Question objects)

			5. Use the "prompt" function to ask the user for the correct answer. The user should input the number of the correct answer as displayed in Step 4.

			6. Check if the answer is correct and print to the console whether the answer is correct or not. (Hint: write another method for this).

			7. Suppose this code would be a plugin for other programmers to use in their code. So make sure that your code is private and doesn't interfere with the other programmers' code (Hint: we learned a special technique to do exactly that).

			--BONUS--
			8. After you display the result, display the next random question, so that the game never ends (Hint: write a function for this and call it right after displaying the result)

			9. Be careful: after Step 8, the game literally never ends. So include the option to quit the game if the user writes "exit" instead of the correct answer. In this case, DON'T call the function from Step 8.

			10. Track the user to make the game more fun! So each time an answer is correct, add 1 point to the score (Hint: I'm using closures for this, but you don't have to).

			11. Display the score in the console. Use yet another method for this. 

			Flow:
			1. Question displayed in console
			2. Enter number of answer in prompt() text box
			3. If answer is correct, display "You're correct!" in the console.
			*/

			var Question = function(question, choices, correctAns) {
				this.question = question
				this.choices = choices;
				this.correctAns = correctAns;
				//console.log(question);
				//console.log(choices);
			};
			//var promptEl = prompt("What is the correct answer to the question below? Choose the number of your answer.");

			var questions = [new Question("Is JavaScript a fundamental programming language?", ["Yes", "No"], 0), new Question("")];

			var randQuestion = Math.round(Math.random() * questions.length + 1);
			console.log(randQuestion);

			//questions[randQuestion] How will I use this?
